# A resolution of the cocktail party problem

This repositories aims to propose a simple resolution of the Cocktail Party Problem.


## Presentation of the Cocktail Party Problem

The cocktail party effect is the phenomenon of the brain's ability to focus one's auditory attention on a particular stimulus while filtering out a range of other stimuli, as when a partygoer can focus on a single conversation in a noisy room. Since the seventies, it has been propose this natural cognitive ability thanks to an Independant Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm.

### Inputs of the program
Two mono or stereo files. The inputs are described as the sources.

### Simulation of the superposition of the input sounds
The superposition of the input sounds is proposed to be computed thanks to three differents ways:
1. A random repartition
2. An arbitrary repartition decided by the user
3. A repartition based on the physics of spheric waves dissipation which needs to provide the spatial positions of the mics and sources.

From the mixing result the audio signals recorded by the mics

### Objective of the program
Retrieve the original source signals from the two overlays recorded by the two microphones.
